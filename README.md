# Class_Management_System
Software Engineering Project 2019


Details: Like other universities and institutes, faculty of IIT KGP need to take one or
more than one courses in every semester. For each of these courses, assigned faculty
need to, for example, record attendance of each student, which is further used to evaluate eligibility
for appearing in the exam as well as studentsâ€™ grade. Thereby, we
require a class management online portal system that reduces most of the overhead
from the faculty, while performing the aforementioned activities of a faculty.

Functionalities:
->Store student details and TA details.
->Enroll students in courses.
->Manage attendance of students.
->Stores evaluation score of assignments and exams for each student.
->Allow to upload and download assignments/submissions.

For the requirements stated above, a Java based Web Application was designed and implemented with the help of MySQL for Database management, Apache Tomcat for hosting application on local network and CSS, JavaScript & HTML for Front-end.
Concept of servlets lie at the core of this project.

Important: This project was made on Netbeans and it requires a sql database created beforehand with name "testdb".A db.sql file is provided.
